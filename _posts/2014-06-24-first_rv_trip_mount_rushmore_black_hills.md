description: This is our first of many trip with our new travel trailer. First up was a trip to the Black Hills and Mount Rushmore
excerpt: <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2771/4237783122_c16dc6cc2b_z.jpg" /> I recently purchased a travel trailer for the family as the cost of plane tickets has made it so we don't travel nearly as much as we used to.  I plan on writing about the hopefully many trips we take and this is the first, Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills.

I am entering a new stage of life...my **National Lampoons Vacation** stage.

Air travel is more expensive and difficult now with two little ones.  The wife and I both grew up with family road trips and RV trips and we want our children to experience that same torture.  There are so many things to experience and see in our own backyard, that list includes:

- [Mount Rushmore](http://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm)
- [Mesa Verde](http://www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm)
- [Grand Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm)
- Awesome mountain towns ([Telluride](http://www.telluride.com/), [Durango](http://www.durango.org/), [Crested Butte](http://www.visitcrestedbutte.com/), [Steamboat](http://www.steamboat-chamber.com/))
- [Colorado National Monument](http://www.nps.gov/colm/index.htm)
- [Royal Gorge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Gorge)
- [Yellowstone](http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm)
- [Zion](http://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm), [Moab](http://www.discovermoab.com/), [Canyonlands](http://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm), and [Arches](http://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm) national parks

The first step involved finding the right RV for our family. I wanted something I could comfortably tow with the Dodge Dakota, the wife had her heart set on bunk beds for the kids. Of course we also wanted something affordable. We shopped around and found many trailers with bunks for the kids, but they were all long and heavy. My truck is rated to tow up to 5500 lbs, but I wanted something under 4000lbs.  These bunk houses we looked at were all about 4500lbs, and that seemed too heavy to me. I also wanted to keep the trailer shorter so that we have more versatility for campsites. I want to be able to take it to dry sites in the National Forest.  So we started looking at hybrids, which have pop-up style beds that extend out of the trailer on both sizes. This kept the trailers small and light, but still gave loads of living space. I really liked the idea of the hybrids because I wanted to be able to unzip them and see the stars and hear the forest. I could feel like I was camping instead of *[glamping](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glamping)*.

Unfortunately, my wife didn't like the idea of the hybrid. She worried about the canvas holding up, keeping it dry, and cooling/heating problems. Fortunately we found a used [2014 Forest River Micro Lite 23 LB]() that was perfect. It had the bunk beds she wanted, and it was only 3700lbs and 23 feet so it met my requirements. It also has a cool design with a murphy queen bed that folds down over the couch, that makes it very spacious when folded up.

##The Trip

The wife has a sister in Rapid City that she has wanted to visit for awhile now.  Rapid City is near the Black Hills and Mount Rushmore, which I have never been to. It seemed like a good first trip. I could get used to towing the trailer, see Mount Rushmore and visit family in a single trip. So we loaded the trailer up and hit the road.

The plan was to leave on a Thursday night and make it to a Walmart in Scottsbluff, NE. As soon as we hit the interstate we had our first problem. The trailer started swaying violently and that caused the front end of the truck to sway. It scared me, but I quickly learned to control the sway when it happened. As soon as we stopped for gas I was able redistribute some weight to the passenger side and that made a huge difference.  I probably should get a sway control hitch, but I think a taller hitch receiver would make a big difference as the trailer seems to sit low and tilt forward when hooked to my truck. 

**The Route**

We made it to the Walmart in Scottsbluff, NE at around midnight.  It was pretty nice, we just nestled in between a few semi, lowered the hitch and climbed aboard the trailer.  It is very cool that Walmart allow this as we didn't need power for a 5 hour rest.  We hit the road around 6 am and headed north to the Black Hills. The drive was pretty easy and I seemed to find a groove towing the trailer and was able to relax.  The one thing that shocked me was just how poor my gas mileage was, I normally get about 18-20 mpg but I was down to 9-11 mpg. This meant stopping often for gas as I have a pretty small gas tank.

###The Black Hills
We arrived at our campground around 11am, right in time for lunch. We stayed at the [Flinstone's Bedrock City RV Park](http://www.flintstonesbedrockcity.com/), which was a little cheesy and dated but it was cheap and Chase (the 2 year old) loved it.  Setting up took a little longer than I expected but I imagine I will get faster with more practice.  We also need to better organize our storage and hookups.  When hooking up I discovered our second problem, we stuck our RV hose in the bumper of the trailer, but one cap must have fallen off and the hose fell out somewhere along the route.  Also, the hot water heater was missing the drain plug, so no hot water this trip.
