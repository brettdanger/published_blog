description: The transition from Software Engineer to Engineering Manager was the most impactful and toughest transition of my career so far.
excerpt: In 2014, my career went a new direction.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to give up programming and become a manager.  In fact, a few years back I was more interested in Product Management than People Management.  However, 6 months in I feel engaged and love this new role.

This last year was a roller coaster ride both personally and professionally.  I will save the personal story for another post, and instead talk about the big transition I made professionally.  In 2014, I made the transition from a software engineer to an engineering manager.  This was a big change.

Like most programmers, I loved the highs from programming.  Solving technical problems and building products gives one a great sense of accomplishment and pride. As much as I wanted  the extra duties and influence that comes with a promotion to manager, I wasn't sure I wanted to give up programming. I was also hesitant to trade programming for boring HR people management stuff like approving vacations and writing reviews.  

It turned out that I was able to trial run a manager position and see how I liked it.  There were a few other engineers at Return Path who were also considering a move into management, also there was an unusually high amount of Engineering manager positions opening up. So three other engineers and I were given the chance to lead our teams as interim managers for 3 months.

Those three months were very eye opening and taught me a lot about myself. I learned that my team respected me and accepted me as a manager (I had doubts about how my team would feel).  I also learned how rewarding it was to help develop and mentor my team members.  The deciding moment was when I was given the opportunity to make an engineering intern that worked on my team over the summer a full time position. It was an amazing feeling presenting the offer letter, it blew away any sense of pride I felt as a programmer.

###Making the Transition
Once I decided this was a transition I wanted to make, I sought advice on how to adjust.  I read some great advice on various blogs, the best was [this article](http://stephenhaunts.com/2014/04/15/transition-from-developer-to-manager/) from Stephen Haunts discussing how to make the transition. I followed his advice on giving up day to day coding duties.  I now take on code projects that have no mission critical deadlines that I can work on when I get free time.  I also keep my technical skills sharp by taking on more personal projects (like this blog), and I even started to get more involved in the meetup community by co-organizing the [Boulder Python](http://www.meetup.com/BoulderPython/) meetup and giving presentations there.  This also helps me recruit, which is now a very important part of my job.

I believe it is important to stay sharp in this area, as an Engineer I preferred technical, former engineer bosses as I felt they had a better grasp of my job, and were obviously better mentors.  I don't want to be Dilbert's boss!

I have now been a manager for 90 days and have grown my team by hiring 3 more engineers and guiding the team to some very important milestones for the company.  I have also read some great articles and blogs on what it means to be a great Engineering manager and leading engineering teams.  Those articles helped me build my personal management philosophy:


###My Philosophy on Leading Engineering Teams

- Simple is Elegant
- I value an ability to learn and a strong curiosity over raw experience
- My teams should have a mix of Junior, Mid and Senior Level engineers
    - This really builds a strong dynamic of learning and teaching.
- Languages, frameworks or patterns don't matter as much as the solution.
- Many engineers value the code over the product, those engineers won't work on my team.
- Having said that, I am a **Python** fan-boy
- Good engineers should know how to extract and transform data to gain real business insights
- I think remote engineers and teams work well and give a company flexibility to build highly talented teams.
- However, Junior engineers should be in office learning from others
- Remote tools and team OS are important, [SLACK](SLACK) and Google Hangouts works for us.
- My job is to meet the business objectives on time with high quality, while also developing and engaging my team members
- Have Fun, fight for fun, budget for fun
- Observe - Throw team lifeline when they fall down rabbit holes
- Let Engineers pick their own solutions and methods as much as possible.
- All these philosophies are subject to change
