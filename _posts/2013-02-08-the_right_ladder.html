description: "Even though I love coding and software engineering  I want to learn more about business and have more strategic input on the projects I am working on.  This is leading me to consider switching roles from an engineer to a product manager."

<p>I am starting to think I am at a crossroads in my career. &nbsp;I love coding, and more specifically I love solving problems with technology. &nbsp;I love the team I a
m on and the role I play on that team. &nbsp;When I think about where I want to be in 5, 10 or even 20 years down the road I can't see myself in engineering.
 &nbsp;The ladder in engineering still goes higher than the rung I am currently on, but it climbs up to the rooftop of a building I don't want to be on. &nbsp;
 The engineering ladder leads to senior engineers, lead engineers, and engineering managers. &nbsp;It's still all engineering, and I want to keep learning m
ore about the process, more about marketing, more about sales, and more about finance. More importantly, I hate the fact that I have very little strategic in
put on our product or what I am building. The problem is in order to change ladders I will have to give up coding. Maybe I am ready to do that maybe I am not
, but the opportunity to jump to another ladder is opening up now.</p> <p>At my company several Product Management jobs are opening up at various points this
year and it is making me consider making a switch. &nbsp;Product Management gives me the opportunity to work with engineering, but also with sales, marketing
, and finance. &nbsp;The Product Management ladder is different then the engineering ladder in that it forks off in many directions instead of going straight
 up. &nbsp;This means that I could go a number of different directions as I climb, and in 20 years I can really be anywhere in the organization (except for m
aybe HR, fine by me). &nbsp;The best part of a jump to product management is that I still get to solve problems with technology, and that could ease the pain
 of quitting coding cold turkey. &nbsp;Have any of you faced similar crossroads? I would love to hear some thoughts in the comments.</p>
