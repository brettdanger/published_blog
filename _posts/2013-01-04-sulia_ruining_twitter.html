description: "Sulia is a new twitter aggregator similar to flipboard, but the way it is being used by the journalist I follow is ruining my timeline."
teaser: "http://media1.sulia.com/static/images/logo_newui.png"
excerpt: "Sulia.com is a good concept and a decent website. &nbsp;I hate the oversized nav links at the top but other than that I have no other gripes about the site. &nbsp;However, 
many of my favorite journalists use it to post thoughts and analysis when 140&nbsp;characters&nbsp;isn't enough. &nbsp;It seems like twitlonger but i
t is actually more useful to posters as it categorizes the post by topic and allows people to view content by topic. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The problem is
 that sulia pays the content creators for clicks, and that tempts the creators to post everything on sulia and simply post a link to sulia on twitter. &nbsp;
I hate twitlonger links in my feed as well. I would prefer a 140 character teaser with a link to a blog in the tweet, because I mostly use a mobile device fo
r twitter consumption. &nbsp;The worst&nbsp;behavior is when the journalist posts a short statement (less than 140 characters) and a link to their blog on su
lia, and then tweets a teaser with a link to sulia. &nbsp;THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING TO DO TO YOUR READERS. &nbsp;Unfortunately, many of my favorite journalist
 (Denverpost.com I am talking to you) do the double link sulia post several times a day.&nbsp; I want to reply to all sulia tweets begging for them to stop,
but I respect these writers and don't want to be rude. &nbsp;How can they use sulia more&nbsp;effectively?<br></p>"
