<p>For years I have been hearing about the <a href="http://tmont.com/blargh/2011/5/php-is-dead-revisited" target="_blank">death of PHP</a>, and I have ignored it.  I bought a Rails cookbook a few years ago, but never even opened it.  Now, as I write more code in other languages, I see how PHP enables my bad habits.  My code get's uglier and uglier as a script ages.  I have used MVC frameworks with PHP like Code Ignitor and Zend and they do force better habits, but I really hate singletons.  I also just want to learn something new. So I can't ignore it anymore, people and startups are moving away from PHP and are using newer, sexier frameworks.</p><!--more-->
<p>I have googled Python vs Ruby, Rails vs Django, etc and all I end up with is flamewars. It seems to boil down to personal preference, and I don't have one. &nbsp;So I need to program in both to decide what my preference is.&nbsp;Therefore, I am embarking on a new project to build something in both Ruby and Python web frameworks. &nbsp;I don't have a blog, and I have been thinking lately that I want a place to compose my thoughts, so that can be my project. &nbsp;I am going to build a wordpress-like blog engine in different frameworks and see what was my preference. However, if I am going to take the time to build something from scratch, I want to also tinker with some other new sexy technologies at the same time. &nbsp;So with that in mind, here are my requirements:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Blog Engine using the web-framework<br></li><li>NoSQL backend, I am picking <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> for this project<br></li><li>Use twitter bootstrap for responsive UI framework<br></li><li>Don't worry about commenting in my app, I will use <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for commenting<br></li></ol><p>I am going to pick mongodb because as a document db it is a good fit for this type of app, and it also shows me the side effects that come when the requirements don't fit the conventions of the framework. &nbsp;In fact I have heard that Rails is difficult to work with if you step out of their box but I will find out for myself&nbsp;whether&nbsp;that is true or not. &nbsp;So now that I had a project in mind and some requirements, it was time to pick my frameworks. &nbsp;I, of course, want to try Rails and Django, but are there others I should consider? &nbsp;After doing some research I have narrowed my list down to Pyramid and Django on the Python side and Rails on the Ruby side, and possibly Node.js if I get time. &nbsp;For the Ruby side it is a no brainer, but Django isn't the one true web framework on Python so I want to try a few python options.</p><p>I decided to start with Pyramid because it seems to be more modular than Django, and I can remove SQLAlchemy and add Pymongo instead. &nbsp;I also wanted to start with Python because I am more familiar with it than Ruby. &nbsp;I have completed my first pass with Pyramid, and have actually deployed my blog to my production VPS and started blogging (obviously). &nbsp;I will post my thoughts on Pyramid here in my next post.</p>
