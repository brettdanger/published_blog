I am a Software Engineer for an [__amazing company__](http://www.returnpath.com) in Denver, Colorado.  In addition to tech/geek/programming topics that I like to read and write about, I also love sports, the outdoors, skiing and of course my family. I have an amazing wife and terrific children that make me laugh every day.

I enjoy full stack programming, but mostly live on the frontend. For the most part I code in Javascript, Python or PHP, and occasionally  in Java or C#. I love finding patterns in data and using it to solve problems or tell stories. Luckily I get to play with loads of data, you could even call it BIG!  

This blog is a place for me to compose some thoughts and share ideas, and I will write about anything that interests me.
